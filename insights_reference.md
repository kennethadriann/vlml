# Valorant Coaching Report Standard v1.0

## Purpose

This document defines the standard framework for producing consistent, high-quality coaching reports using MCP esports data. All reports should follow this structure to ensure:

1. **Consistency** - Every report follows the same format
2. **Actionability** - Insights lead to concrete coaching actions
3. **Data Integrity** - All claims are backed by verifiable metrics
4. **Clarity** - Information is organized for quick consumption

---

## Report Types

### Type 1: Match Analysis Report
**Use Case:** Post-match breakdown for coaching review
**Scope:** Single series (1-5 maps)

### Type 2: Player Profile Report  
**Use Case:** Individual player assessment across multiple matches
**Scope:** 5+ series minimum for statistical significance

### Type 3: Scouting Report
**Use Case:** Pre-match opponent preparation
**Scope:** Opponent's last 5-10 series

### Type 4: Pattern Detection Report
**Use Case:** Identifying recurring issues or strengths
**Scope:** Full tournament or stage data

---

## Standard Sections (All Report Types)

### Section 1: Executive Summary
**Length:** 3-5 sentences maximum
**Content:**
- Match/analysis result
- Single most important finding
- Primary recommendation

**Example:**
> Cloud9 defeated NRG 2-1 in the Stage 2 Playoffs semifinal. The series was decided by opening duel differential (+3 FB for C9) and clutch conversion (C9 3/4 vs NRG 0/0). Priority VOD review: NRG's entry timing on Haven rounds 2, 4, 7, 8 where mada died first.

### Section 2: Key Metrics Dashboard
**Format:** Table with comparative data
**Required Metrics:**

| Metric Category | Metrics Required |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Opening Duels | FB, FD, FB%, FD%, Net FB Diff |
| Conversion | FB Conversion Rate, FD Salvage Rate |
| Impact | Multi-kills (2k, 3k, 4k, Ace), Clutches (attempts, wins, rate) |
| Consistency | KAST%, ADR, K/D |
| Economy | Pistol Win%, Eco Win%, Thrifty Count |

### Section 3: Round-by-Round Analysis
**Format:** Condensed timeline with key events
**Required Data Points per Round:**
- Round number
- Opening duel winner/loser
- Round winner
- High-impact events (3k+, clutch, ace)
- Coaching flag (if applicable)

**Coaching Flags:**
- 🔴 **REVIEW** - Something went wrong that needs VOD review
- 🟡 **PATTERN** - This round fits a recurring pattern
- 🟢 **REPLICATE** - Successful play to study and repeat
- ⚪ **STANDARD** - Normal round, no special attention needed

### Section 4: Issue Identification
**Format:** Numbered list with evidence
**Structure per Issue:**
```
Issue #[N]: [Short Title]
- Description: [1-2 sentences]
- Evidence: [Specific rounds/stats]
- Frequency: [X of Y rounds, or X%]
- Impact: [Rounds lost, damage to economy, etc.]
- Root Cause Hypothesis: [Team structure, individual, timing, etc.]
```

### Section 5: VOD Review Priority Queue
**Format:** Ranked list of rounds to review
**Include:**
- Round number and map
- Reason for review
- Specific player(s) to focus on
- Question to answer from VOD

**Example:**
```
1. Haven R8 - C9 won FB but lost round. Watch: Trade timing after v1c's opener
2. Haven R14 - skuba 4K but NRG lost. Watch: Post-plant positioning
3. Haven R22 - mada ACE. Watch: Entry path for replication
```

### Section 6: Action Plan
**Format:** Categorized recommendations
**Categories:**
- **Immediate** (this week's practice)
- **Short-term** (next 2-3 weeks)
- **Long-term** (strategic adjustments)

---

## Data Quality Standards

### Minimum Sample Sizes

| Analysis Type | Minimum Rounds | Minimum Series |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| Single Match Report | All rounds in match | 1 |
| Player Profile | 100+ rounds | 5+ |
| Team Patterns | 200+ rounds | 10+ |
| Agent-Specific | 50+ rounds on agent | 3+ |
| Map-Specific | 75+ rounds on map | 5+ |

### Statistical Confidence Labels

- **Strong Signal** (n ≥ 100): "Pattern is..."
- **Moderate Signal** (50 ≤ n < 100): "Trend suggests..."
- **Weak Signal** (20 ≤ n < 50): "Early indication that..."
- **Insufficient Data** (n < 20): "Limited data shows... (not statistically significant)"

### Required Context for All Percentages

Always provide numerator and denominator:
- ✅ "75% clutch win rate (3/4)"
- ❌ "75% clutch win rate"

---

## Metric Calculation Standards

### Opening Duel Metrics

```sql
-- First Blood Rate (player)
FB% = first_bloods / rounds_played

-- First Death Rate (player)  
FD% = first_deaths / rounds_played

-- Opening Duel Rating (player)
OD_Rating = (first_bloods - first_deaths) / rounds_played

-- FB Conversion Rate (team)
FB_Conv% = rounds_won_with_fb / rounds_with_fb

-- FD Salvage Rate (team)
FD_Salv% = rounds_won_despite_fd / rounds_with_fd
```

### Impact Metrics

```sql
-- Multi-kill Round Rate
MK_Rate = rounds_with_2k_or_more / rounds_played

-- Clutch Efficiency
Clutch_Eff = clutches_won / clutch_attempts

-- Clutch Difficulty Score
Clutch_Diff = AVG(opponents_faced_in_clutch)

-- True Impact Score (custom)
Impact = (kills + 0.5*assists + 2*clutches_won + 1.5*first_bloods) / rounds_played
```

### Consistency Metrics

```sql
-- KAST Rate
KAST% = rounds_with_kill_assist_survive_or_trade / total_rounds

-- Average Damage per Round
ADR = total_damage / rounds_played

-- Kill Participation
KP% = (kills + assists) / team_total_kills
```

---

## Visualization Standards

### Tables

**Column Order (left to right):**
1. Identifier (Player, Round, Map)
2. Primary metrics
3. Secondary metrics
4. Comparative/benchmark data
5. Flags/notes

**Formatting:**
- Bold headers
- Right-align numbers
- Include totals/averages where applicable
- Use consistent decimal places (1 for rates, 0 for counts)

### Round Timeline Format

```
R1  | C9 FB (neT→skuba) | C9 Win | OXY 4K 🟢
R2  | C9 FB (Xeppaa→mada) | C9 Win | Standard ⚪
R3  | C9 FB (v1c→brawk) | C9 Win | Standard ⚪
...
R8  | C9 FB (v1c→mada) | NRG Win | Lost 5v4 🔴
```

---

## Language Standards

### Prohibited Phrases
- "It seems like..." (be definitive or state uncertainty explicitly)
- "They should probably..." (be specific about recommendations)
- "The player was bad..." (focus on actions, not judgments)
- "Obviously..." (nothing is obvious; state the evidence)

### Required Phrasing

| Instead of... | Use... |
|---------------|--------|
| "bad performance" | "below-average output (X ADR vs Y team avg)" |
| "they kept dying" | "first death in X of Y rounds (Z%)" |
| "they're good at clutching" | "converted X of Y clutches (Z%)" |
| "their economy was bad" | "force-bought in X rounds following eco" |

### Framing Issues as Systems Problems

Always frame individual issues in team context:
- ❌ "mada keeps dying first"
- ✅ "mada's entry died first in 5/12 rounds - check if util support is arriving on time or if timing is predictable"

```sql
-- Team clutch performance over time
SELECT 
    p.player_name,
    COUNT(*) as clutch_situations,
    SUM(CASE WHEN p.clutch_won THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as clutches_won,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN p.clutch_won THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 1) as clutch_rate,
    ROUND(AVG(p.clutch_opponents), 2) as avg_difficulty
FROM agg_player_round_stats p
WHERE p.team_name = '{team_name}'
  AND p.is_clutch = true
GROUP BY p.player_name
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5
ORDER BY clutch_rate DESC

## Appendix B: Issue Detection Thresholds

These thresholds determine when a metric becomes a **flagged issue** requiring coaching attention.

### B1. Individual Player Thresholds

| Metric | Role | Warning | Critical | Notes |
|--------|------|---------|----------|-------|
| Opening Death Rate | Duelist | >18% | >22% | Duelists expected to take fights |
| Opening Death Rate | Non-Duelist | >12% | >15% | Support players dying first is structural |
| KAST | All | <55% | <50% | Below 50% = not contributing |
| ADR | Duelist | <100 | <85 | Duelists need damage output |
| ADR | Non-Duelist | <80 | <65 | Support still needs presence |
| Untraded Death % | All | >35% | >45% | Team not trading properly |
| Clutch Win Rate | All (n≥5) | <40% | <30% | Sample size matters |

### B2. Team-Level Thresholds

| Metric | Warning | Critical | Notes |
|--------|---------|----------|-------|
| FB Conversion Rate | <70% | <60% | Not capitalizing on advantages |
| FD Salvage Rate | <25% | <20% | Collapsing after disadvantage |
| Pistol Win Rate | <45% | <35% | Economy snowball issues |
| Trade Success Rate | <60% | <50% | Spacing/timing problems |
| Post-Plant Win Rate (ATK) | <55% | <45% | Not holding post-plant |

### B3. Pattern Detection Thresholds

| Pattern | Trigger Condition |
|---------|-------------------|
| Entry Predictability | Same player dies first 3+ times in a half |
| FB Conversion Fail Streak | Lose 3+ rounds despite winning FB |
| Clutch Dependency | >25% of round wins come from clutches |
| Map Weakness | Win rate <35% on a map (n≥5 games) |
| Agent Discomfort | >5% worse KD on specific agent vs average |

### B4. VOD Review Priority Scoring

Rounds are auto-prioritized for VOD review based on:

| Event | Priority Score | Reason |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| Won FB, Lost Round | +10 | Should have converted |
| Lost FB, Won Round | +7 | How did we salvage? |
| Clutch Won | +6 | Replicable play |
| Clutch Lost | +5 | What went wrong? |
| Ace | +5 | Study the setup |
| 4K+ | +4 | High impact play |
| Player died first 3+ times | +8 | Pattern issue |
| Overtime round | +3 | High pressure decision |
